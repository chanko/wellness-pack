## Goal
Review `daily_log.md` to find biological patterns.

## Execution Steps
1.  **Read History**: Scan the last 7-14 days of logs.
2.  **Identify Cycle Phase**:
    - Where is the user in their infradian rhythm? (e.g., Late Luteal).
3.  **Correlate**:
    - **Energy vs. Cycle**: "You reported low energy on days 26-28, which is typical as hormones drop before menstruation."
    - **Food vs. Mood**: "You noted bloating after the dairy on Tuesday."
4.  **Report**:
    - Provide 3 bullet points of scientific observation.
    - Suggest 1 actionable adjustment (e.g., "Try increasing magnesium this week to help with the cramps").
